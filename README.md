## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

By taking this Frontend mentor challenge i was able to practise my media query skills and to build this project with a mobile first approach. 

I also learnt how to use flexbox to help me center to "Add To Cart" text and cart icon on the button element which I thought was a cool little trick. I think flexbox is a really cool & Powerful CSS feature which I also used for transisitioning the layout from a mobile viewport design to a desktop viewport design.

I was strugling to maintain the aspect ratio for the size of the product image once the viewport was nearer to desktop width. But then set a height on the product image in my desktop media query & used the max-width CSS property on the main container to maintain the correct dimensions for the product card.

### Continued development

I would like to continue focusing on flexbox and to master the true powers of this powerful CSS tool until it becomes second nature.

I some times get the properties mixed up between the flex container and the flex children and have recently discovered that an element can be both a flex container and a flex child at the same time.

I would also like to brush up on CSS Grids too as i haven't had the chance to implement them and could do with some practise.

I hope to start implementing some javascript in future challenge projects too as i really feel like javascript is the missing piece to the puzzle.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys&t=65787s) - This Video helped me understand the concept of Flexbox. I really liked this resource and will use it going forward.
